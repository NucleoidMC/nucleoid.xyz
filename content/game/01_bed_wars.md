BedWars is a team-based game where players must bridge over a void to each other's bases in order to break their beds. Once a bed is broken, that team is unable to respawn!

There are various resource generators throughout the map and in the team bases, which allow players to buy various tools, items, and team upgrades from shops. Players must fight to control these resources, as well as protect their bed in order to be the final remaining team!
