Quakecraft is a fast-paced free-for-all game in which players must battle each other to 24 kills.

Players can make use of various weapons, such as: 
- A railgun, which instantly kills anything in its path. Left-click will propel the player forwards.
- A rocket launcher, which shoots a fireball with an area-of-effect impact.
- A grenade launcher, which shoots a grenade. The grenade will blow up after a few seconds or on impact.
