Cake Wars is an alternative take on the BedWars genre where a number of teams battle it out in the sky.
When you die, you respawn at your cake. The aim of the game is to destroy the other teams' cakes while protecting your own: if your cake is destroyed, you can no longer respawn! 
The item shop has been revamped for this gamemode, with a number of villagers available where items can be bought for different "currencies".
