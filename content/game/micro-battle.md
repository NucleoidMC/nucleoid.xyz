Micro battle is a free-for-all or team-based game in which players duel in order to become the last one standing!

The game has three modes:
 - Standard: everybody receives the same kits
 - Soul Mode: players are randomly assigned kits with unique abilities
 - Respawner Mode: every player receives a beacon to place, which allows them to respawn until it is broken

The game can additionally be played with 1.8-style combat with teams or solos.
