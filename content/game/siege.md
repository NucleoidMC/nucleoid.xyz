Siege is a work-in-progress point-capture team-based game in which the **Attackers** must take over all of the territory from the **Defenders** before time runs out. 
Players can choose from a variety of kits, but resources are limited, and must be restocked by using an ender chest. 

The kits currently include: the Archer, the Soldier, the Shield Bearer, and the Constructor.
