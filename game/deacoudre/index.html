    Dé à Coudre
  </h1>
  <p><p>Dé à Coudre is a free-for-all turn-based game in which players compete to be the last one standing.
Players jump into water, replacing it with a block. If a player jumps into a water block surrounded by 4 solid blocks, they win an extra life. If you lose all your lives by landing on solid blocks, you are eliminated!</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a &quot;Chaotic Mode&quot; of Dé à Coudre, where every player jumps at the same time. The game ends when the board is filled, and the winner is the player with the most points.</p>
