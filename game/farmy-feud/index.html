    Farmy Feud
  </h1>
  <p><p>Farmy Feud is a team-based minigame in which players must steal sheep for their farms, and hold the most number of sheep before the timer runs out! Sheep are spawned periodically at the center of the map; but to come out on top, you will need to steal from the other neighbouring farms.</p>
<p>Players get swords, axes (which allow them to leap when used), and a bow that slowly recharges arrows. Sheep are dropped upon hit. </p>
