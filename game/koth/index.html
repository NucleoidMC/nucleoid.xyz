    King of the Hill
  </h1>
  <p><p>King of the Hill is a free-for-all party game in which players compete to become the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (however, people of any identity can play this game). Standing on a capture point gives points, and the person with the most points at the end of the time limit wins. </p>
<p>There is also a &quot;Deathmatch Mode&quot; which is based on the last-player-standing, where the first player to win three rounds wins. </p>
