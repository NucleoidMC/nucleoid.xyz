    Shard Thief
  </h1>
  <p><p>Shard Thief is a free-for-all party game in which players must try and hold the <strong>Prismarine Shards</strong>! You can make a player drop their shard by shooting with a bow or punching them. Once they drop their shard, a prismarine block appears on the ground which you can stand on to pick up. If the shard is held by a single player for long enough, they win! </p>
